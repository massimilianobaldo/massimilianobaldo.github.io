# Development
So in this branch I'm gonna working all the stuff discovered and studied in my University.  
The scope is to have a final version which is like a portfolio about me.

In this specific case, I se Sass, Swup.js and the Particels.js

# Todo
- [ ] Create the About Me section.

- [ ] Make the button fixed (not scrollable) to go home.

- [ ] Add for alle the section a specific id.

- [ ] Use Sass to create a signle css file.

- [ ] Try to understand Gia.js.
